# üßæ StudelyDesk ‚Äì Helpdesk Ticketing System with Docker & AKS

**StudelyDesk** is a lightweight helpdesk and ticketing web application built with **Flask**. It enables users to easily submit support requests while providing administrators with a streamlined interface to manage and resolve tickets efficiently.

The application is containerized using **Docker**, ensuring consistency across development and production environments. For scalability and cloud-native orchestration, it is deployed on **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**, allowing it to handle growing workloads seamlessly.

## üöÄ Features

- User-friendly submission and tracking of helpdesk tickets  
- Admin dashboard to view, update, and resolve tickets  
- RESTful API design for easy integration and extension  
- Fully containerized for portability with Docker  
- Scalable, reliable deployment using Kubernetes on AKS

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python 3 with Flask framework  
- **Frontend:** HTML and CSS with Bootstrap for responsive design  
- **Database:** SQLite (used for demonstration and simplicity)  
- **Containerization:** Docker for creating reproducible application images  
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes deployed via Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)  
- **Tools:** Azure CLI and kubectl for managing cloud resources and Kubernetes clusters

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD ‚Äì Continuous Integration and Deployment

This project uses **GitHub Actions** to automate the build, test, and deployment process for the application on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

### Workflow Details

- Triggered on every push to the `main` branch
- Steps included in the workflow:
  1. Checkout source code  
  2. Login to Azure using secure credentials stored in GitHub Secrets  
  3. Login to Azure Container Registry (ACR)  
  4. Build the Docker image and tag it  
  5. Push the Docker image to ACR  
  6. Set up `kubectl` context for AKS cluster  
  7. Update the Kubernetes deployment with the new Docker image  
  8. Monitor the deployment rollout status to ensure successful update  

### Benefits of this CI/CD Pipeline

- Automates deployment, reducing manual errors  
- Ensures the latest code changes are immediately reflected in the production environment  
- Maintains consistency between code, container image, and deployment  
- Supports scaling and efficient resource management with Kubernetes

## üêò Migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL

To prepare the application for production-level use, the database has been migrated from SQLite to **PostgreSQL**.

### Why PostgreSQL?

- Better handling of concurrent users and multiple connections  
- Native support for distributed systems like Kubernetes  
- Compatibility with managed cloud services (e.g. Azure Database for PostgreSQL)  
- Richer data types and improved performance for larger datasets
